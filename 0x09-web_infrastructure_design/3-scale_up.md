Application servr vs Web server
===============================

The basic task of an application server is to provide clients with access to the so-called business 
logic that generates dynamic content. That is, code that transforms data to provide specialized functionality provided by an enterprise, 
service, or application. Often the client of an application server is the application itself, which may include web servers and other 
application servers. Communication between an application  server and its clients can be in the form of HTTP messages, but this is the
case for communication between a web server and its clients, so it is not required. Many other protocols are common, including CGI variants.

The basic job of a web server is to accept and fulfill client requests for the static content of a website (HTML pages, files, images, videos, etc.). 
The client is most often a browser or mobile application, and requests take the form of HTTP (Hypertext Transfer Protocol) messages, much like web
server responses.
